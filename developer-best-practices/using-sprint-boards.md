# Using Sprint Boards

## Learning Goals
- Understand Ada's recommended best-practices for using sprint boards in Trello
- Practice creating a sprint board with tasks scheduled by sprint

## Prerequisite
This lesson will be hard to follow if students haven't first received the [Intro to Agile lesson](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/textbook-curriculum/blob/master/00-programming-fundamentals/intro-to-agile.md)

## Ada Best Practices
1. Create cards as User Stories 
    - Format: "As a user, I can ...[, so that I...]". 
        - eg. "As a user, I can browse products by merchant, so that I can explore all the cool stuff my favorite merchant sells and buy more stuff."
    - This helps you as a developer focus on what matters to the user. Without articulating your work this way, it's SO EASY to get distracted by lots of technical issues that may or may not actually matter to the user your application is meant to serve.
1. Sort user stories by priority and approach the project by focusing on completing one story at a time.
    - For group projects, this means focusing on one story at a time per person.
1. Use checklists on each user story to break the story up into smaller tasks. 
    - This makes it easier to ensure every task you’re working on is directly related to the user story you’re currently focused on.
    - This way, with each user story you complete, you know you already have this much to show off for your demo!
1. Organize Trello cards by “Sprint/Week”. 
    - This way you have some idea how you’re tracking: whether you’re ahead, behind, or on-track. 
    - The easiest way to do this is probably to estimate what percentage of your project each user story represents and set a due date for it accordingly. 
      - eg. If a story represents ~30% of what you have left to do for the project, it should be due in 13 days * .30 = 3.9 days (or around to 4 days).
1. If there are one or two user stories that feel the scariest or riskiest, see if you can do those first. 
    - That will give you more time to make mistakes and it will give you more time to change your idea if something seems like it isn’t quite going to work like you expected.

  ## Exercise
  TODO This is a lot of information. We need to give students a chance to apply all this.
  We could use an example Trello that we build as a class or ask bEtsy groups to create and/or update their boards based on these practices (or both?).
