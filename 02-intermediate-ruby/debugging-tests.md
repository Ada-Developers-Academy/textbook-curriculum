# Debugging Tests

## Learning Goals
- Understand how to add new debug configurations to VS Code
- See how testing tests is different than testing code
- Be able to run and debug a single test in a spec file

You've gained confidence debugging using VS Code. You know all about looking for weird data in your variables, you have watched your execution pointer jump around to different parts of a file, perhaps you've even set a watch! But now you want more. More tools, more debugging, more POWER.

It's time to be able to debug a Minitest Spec file.
