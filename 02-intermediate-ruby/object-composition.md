Idea: exhibit different types of relation

  - Author - books
- many-to-many?

## Learning Goals
By the end of this lesson, students should be able to...
- Define _object composition_
- Compare and contrast three different types of composition relations
  - One-to-many
  - One-to-one
  - Many-to-many

## Object Composition

When building even a moderate sized program, it is unusual for objects to exist in a vacuum. Instead, objects tend to work together, each responsible for a single piece of a larger problem.

For example, in the Solar System project we have two classes that work together. `Planet` is responsible for keeping track of the details of a single planet, and `SolarSystem` is responsible for keeping track of a collection of `Planet`s. By identifying and isolating these two responsibilities, we can build a complex system while keeping the individual pieces relatively simple.

## TODO IMAGE (planets in a solar system)

If we were to describe this relationship in English, we would use the term _has a_: "a solar system _has a_ collection of planets". In programming, we call the creation of these _has a_ relationships **object composition**.

Today, we'll be discussing three different types of composition relationships:
- One-to-many
- One-to-one
- Many-to-many

### One-to-one



## Learning Goals
- Put a name to something we've been doing: _Composition_
- Learn how to describe relationships between objects in terms of _has-a_, and _is-a_
- Use _composition_ to bring behavior from one class into another
    + We want _composition_ when `first_class` _has-a_ `second_class`
    + The classic example: `Car` _has-a_ `Wheel`

## _is-a_ vs. _has-a_
From __Learn Ruby The Hard Way__:
  > You use the phrase _is-a_ when you talk about objects and classes being related to each other by a class relationship. You use _has-a_ when you talk about objects and classes that are related only because they __reference__ each other.

We will discuss _is-a_ relationships in the next lecture. For now, let's say that we have a way to express that one class will _inherit_ behaviors from another, like a `Duck` class inheriting the behaviors from a `Bird` class. We could say `Duck` _is-a_ `Bird`. Right now, I want to focus on _has-a_ relationships.

## Object Composition: _has-a_
_Composition_ is the concept that a class can be _composed_ of other classes as parts, much like how a car has wheels. What we've done so far with relationships between classes (think `Account` and `Owner`, `SolarSystem` and `Planet`) has been _composition_, we've just never labeled it as such.

A way to describe this is by using the _has-a_ phrase: i.e. `Car` has a `Wheel`, `SolarSystem` has many `Planet`s.


```ruby
class Developer
  attr_accessor :name
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
    @code = Code.new
  end

  def code
    @code.make_bugs
  end
end

class Code
  def make_bugs
    "typey typey typey ERROR"
  end
end

```

In the example above, `Developer` _has-a_ `Code`. Each has its own data and behaviors. Telling an instance of `Developer` to `code` invokes the `make_bugs` method on an instance of `Code`. `Developer` has a behavior (`code`) that is _encapsulated_ by the `Code` class. Maybe a `Developer` can `code` without `make_bugs` happening, but we haven't taught it how yet.

## Small Note _acts-like_

Another form of _composition_ is described by an _acts-like_ relationship. This relationship leverages Ruby modules to `include` shared behavior in __unrelated classes__. You may find this type of composition referenced online or in books.  We will not use this type of composition in class, but know that `acts-like` is an uncommon type of composition.  

## Summary

We've seen that Composition defines a _has-a_ relationship where a class is constructed by using other classes to provide the needed functionality.  This makes our code more modular and lets each class focus on it's single area of responsibility.  We create complex functionality by combining smaller, simpler classes.  To do so our classes create instances of other classes and use them.

You will find that composition is much more commonly used to add functionality to our classes compared to inheritance.  In general use composition unless there are clearly related concepts that fit as a single concept or because you have to because of a library you are using.
