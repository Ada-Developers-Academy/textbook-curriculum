# Testing APIs

# TODO: No Rails

## Learning Goals
- Identify the areas of APIs that we want to test
- Utilize VCR to snapshot API calls
- Integrate tests

### How is testing APIs different?
We know why testing is important, we have seen the importance of the TDD cycle. When testing APIs it is important to note that we are now relying on external sources for our own code to work. There are a few things to consider when testing external sources:

1. If they're down, we're down
1. Every API call costs something (whether it be counting against your # of free calls or actually costing real $)

With these two considerations in mind, we want to reduce the dependency on an external API in testing, so we can focus on the important pieces of our code. In comes VCR!

### What is VCR?
VCR is a tool that allows your tests to _record_ HTTP interactions and replay them when necessary. By re-using these responses, VCR will improve stability and performance of your test suite.

Each interaction is recorded as a **cassette**. We can load cassettes in our tests, depending on which requests/responses we want to be testing.

### Installation
1. **Gem**

  There are a few gems that we want to include to test using VCR. First, we'll load those into our `development` and `test` sections.

  ```ruby
  group :development, :test do
    gem 'minitest-vcr'
    gem 'webmock'
  end
  ```

2. **Test Config**

  In your `test_helper.rb` file, add the following code:
  ```ruby
  require 'vcr'
  require 'webmock/minitest'

  VCR.configure do |config|
    config.cassette_library_dir = 'test/cassettes' # folder where casettes will be located
    config.hook_into :webmock # tie into this other tool called webmock
    config.default_cassette_options = {
      :record => :new_episodes,    # record new data when we don't have it yet
      :match_requests_on => [:method, :uri, :body] # The http method, URI and body of a request all need to match
    }
    # Don't leave our Slack token lying around in a cassette file.
    config.filter_sensitive_data("<SLACK_TOKEN>") do
      ENV['SLACK_TOKEN']
    end
  end
  ```

  The last section, beginning with `config.filter_sensitive_data`, tells VCR not to put your slack token into the cassette file, instead replacing it with the string `"<SLACK_TOKEN>"`. That way when the cassettes end up in your git repo, you won't be exposing your secrets to the world. You'll need a separate call to `config.filter_sensitive_data` for every piece of data you want to omit from your cassettes.

  Cassette files usually should be checked into git - they fill the same role as test fixtures.

3. **Tests**

  Now you're ready to test your API!!

  We wrap the code where an API call would be made in the `VCR.use_cassette` block. This will ensure that the code inside the block will use the cassette if it has not already been generated.

  ```ruby
  it "Can send valid message to real channel" do
    VCR.use_cassette("channels") do
      message = "test message"
      response = SlackApiWrapper.send_msg("<CHANNELID>", message)
      response["ok"].must_equal true
      response["message"]["text"].must_equal message
    end
  end
  ```

  Test a negative case:
  ```ruby
  it "Can't send message to fake channel" do
    VCR.use_cassette("channels") do
      response = SlackApiWrapper.send_msg("this-channel-does-not-exist", "test message")
      response["ok"].must_equal false
      response["error"].wont_be_nil
    end
  end
  ```

Once you run a test that uses VCR, you'll notice that there will be a file in the `test/cassettes` folder with the name corresponding to the parameter provided in the `use_cassette` method.

If you expect the response data to change, you must delete the cassette file.

Once the cassette file is created, how do we know that our tests are not still calling the API directly? One (very manual) way of doing this is by turning off your Wifi. If you ensure you have the VCR cassette files, then turn off your Wifi and run your tests again, your tests should still pass! Huzzah!

**Note** You will also need to place the `VCR.use_cassette` block around your controller tests as well.  Otherwise your controller tests, which use the API will fail.
