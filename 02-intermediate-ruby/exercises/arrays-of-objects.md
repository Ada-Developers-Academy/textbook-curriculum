# Exercise:  Processing an Array of Objects

You've been contracted by a hip bar/grill in Singapore to finish developing a system that another developer started. This system should calculate a bill for the customer when they place their order.  An `Order` will consist of a number of `OrderItem`s which will each have a name, quantity, unit price and an indicator if it is a sugary beverage.

Your team leader has provided [these tests](sample_code/order_spec.rb).
