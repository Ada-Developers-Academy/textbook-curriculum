# Testing Practice

In this exercise you will practice writing a set of methods to calculate a resturant bill in a TDD manner.  Use the starter code on the [Bill Calculator repository](https://github.com/adagold/bill_calculator).

1.   Look at the file `subtotal_spec.rb`.  The tests are pre-written, create a `subtotal` method in `bill.rb` which takes an array of numbers and returns the sum.
2.   Now look at `tax_spec.rb` the tests blocks are filled-in, but the body of the `it` blocks are incomplete, pratice writing the `tax` method which will take a list of numbers describing the costs of items on a resturant bill and a tax rate and returns the total tax for that bill.
3.  Next complete `total_spec.rb` and the `total` method which will take an array of hashes listing items on the bill and a tax rate and return the total amount due.  You will need to come up with your own test cases for this method.
