# Testing With Minitest

Minitest is the default testing framework for Ruby.  We will learn and explore writing tests by creating a class which simulates a bill with the ability to calculate, subtotal, tax and total.  We could use such a class in any number of e-commerce applications or even a Point of Sale (POS) system.  We are going to build the `Bill` class in a TDD fashion using Minitest, as our testing framework.  In doing so we will both learn the syntax of Minitest and practice writing code in a TDD fashion.

## Learning Goals
- Discover techniques to verify our code performs as expected using _automated tests_
- Learn the syntax of Minitest spec-style testing
- Test code using _expectations_
- Practice spotting _nominal_ and _edge cases_.
- Have a basic grasp on what _Rake_ & _Rakefiles_ are

## Starter Files

As we work we will use the files located in this [repository](https://github.com/AdaGold/bill_calculator).  Fork & Clone the repository and follow along as you go.

Our starter code has 2 files we will focus on.
- `bill.rb` a file we will build our class in to simulate a bill.
- `bill_spec.rb` a file in which we will place tests to verify that our code meets expectations.

### Before We Get Started

Because colored output is so much nicer we'll add a gem called [minitest-reporters.](https://github.com/kern/minitest-reporters)

Run this command in your terminal.

```bash
$  gem install minitest-reporters
```

### How To Use Minitest?

To start with we'll add some code to `bill_spec.rb`.  We will also require `minitest/autorun`

```ruby
# bill_spec.rb

require 'minitest/autorun'
require 'minitest/reporters'
require_relative 'bill'

Minitest::Reporters.use!
```

Note that `bill.rb` which will hold our class is currently empty.

```ruby
# bill.rb
```


We can run the tests by typing:  `ruby bill_spec.rb` and get the following:

```bash
$ ruby bill_spec.rb
Run options: --seed 35264

# Running:



Finished in 0.000751s, 0.0000 runs/s, 0.0000 assertions/s.

0 runs, 0 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```

Minitest is running (Yippie!), but we haven't actually written a test yet.


#### Writing Your First Test

To start we'll need to create a `description` block and place our tests inside that block.


#### Step 1:  Create a `describe` block

```ruby
# bill_spec.rb
require 'minitest/autorun'
require 'minitest/reporters'
require_relative 'bill'

Minitest::Reporters.use!

describe "Bill" do

end
```

The `describe` block indicates that this contains a suite of tests.  Minitest will run these tests together and any instance variables created inside this block will be shared among the test cases.

#### Step 2:  Create an `it` block

Now we'll create an `it` block which is a test-case.  Each `describe` block can have many `it` blocks inside it and even many `describe` blocks.  Each `it` block however should focus on testing one specific thing, while `describe` blocks are used to group a set of tests.


```ruby
# bill_spec.rb

require 'minitest/autorun'
require 'minitest/reporters'
require_relative 'bill'

Minitest::Reporters.use!


describe "Bill" do
  it "Can be created" do
    # Testing goes in here
  end
end
```

#### Step 3:  Add an expectation


So we have a test-case, but it's not actually checking anything yet.  So we can add an _expectation_ which is a method call that describes a condition it **expects** the given item to meet.  In this case we need to **expect** that if we create a bill, it's an instance of the Bill class.  Expectations typically start with `must_` or `wont_`.

So lets write our expectation

```ruby
# bill_spec.rb

require 'minitest/autorun'
require 'minitest/reporters'
require_relative 'bill'

Minitest::Reporters.use!

describe "Bill" do
  it "Can be created" do
    bill = Bill.new
    # the class of @bill should be Bill
    expect(bill.class).must_equal Bill
  end
end
```

Notice the line `expect(bill.class).must_equal Bill`.  Minitest adds an `expect` method which returns an object with a bunch of expectations including the `must_equal` method.  Most expectations take one required argument.  If the required argument to `expect` is equal to the object `must_equal` is being called on, the expectation passes, otherwise it fails.

When we run this with `ruby bill_spec.rb` we get:

```bash
ruby bill_spec.rb
Run options: --seed 21626

# Running:

EE

Error:
bill#test_0001_can be created:
NameError: uninitialized constant Bill
    bill_spec.rb:9:in `block (2 levels) in <main>'


bin/rails test bill_spec.rb:8



Finished in 0.003340s, 299.4012 runs/s, 0.0000 assertions/s.

  1) Error:
bill#test_0001_can be created:
NameError: uninitialized constant Bill
    bill_spec.rb:9:in `block (2 levels) in <main>'

1 runs, 0 assertions, 0 failures, 1 errors, 0 skips



Finished in 0.457662s, 2.1850 runs/s, 0.0000 assertions/s.
1 runs, 0 assertions, 0 failures, 1 errors, 0 skips
```

**This is a good thing.**  We have our first **red** test.  There's an error because we haven't created the Bill class yet.

####  Step 4:  Write Code To Make It Pass

Lets make the test pass by creating a Bill class.

```ruby
# bill.rb

class Bill

end
```

Now `ruby bill_spec.rb` gets us:

```bash
Run options: --seed 32657

# Running:

..

Finished in 0.001089s, 918.2736 runs/s, 918.2736 assertions/s.

1 runs, 1 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips

Finished in 0.454822s, 2.1987 runs/s, 2.1987 assertions/s.
1 runs, 1 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips

```

Now we have our first **green/passing** test.

There are a [number of expectations](http://mattsears.com/articles/2011/12/10/minitest-quick-reference/) in Minitest beyond the `must_equal` method.

**Exercise** Look at the list of expectations above and revise the `expect(bill.class).must_equal Bill` to use the `must_be_instance_of` expectation instead.


#### A Word on Parentheses

In the code above, we are calling `must_equal` without using parentheses `expect(bill.class).must_equal Bill`.  Ruby doesn't FORCE you to put parentheses around a method's arguments but [the community-driven style guidelines](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide#method-invocation-parens) suggest that it's good coding style to put parentheses around method arguments **except** for methods which are part of an internal Domain Specific Language (DSL), or basically the syntax of some kind of framework like... Minitest.

So you shouldn't put parentheses around the arguments to `must` method arguments, but you **should** around your own methods.

### Adding Functionality

We are going to require that Bill must be instantiated with a list (array) of prices (integers).  Each item will have a name and price.  So we will revise the test to look like this:

```ruby
# bill_spec.rb

require 'minitest/autorun'
require 'minitest/reporters'
require_relative 'bill'

Minitest::Reporters.use!

describe "bill" do
  it "can be created" do
    bill = Bill.new([4.75, 8.75])
    # the class of @bill should be Bill
    expect(bill.class).must_equal Bill
  end
end
```

#### Our First Edge Cases

You may remember from the [Introduction to Automated Testing](../00-programming-fundamentals/intro-to-automated-tests.md) that we also have an edge-case when the list is empty.  As designers we decide what to do when:

1. A `Bill` is constructed without an argument
1. A `Bill` is constructed with a non-array argument
1. Or Bill.new is called an empty list

We will choose, for now, to ignore the case where someone creates a `Bill` without an argument or with an non-array.  We will come back to this on another day.  In the case of an empty array, the bill should be zero.

So we will add another `it` block.

```ruby
it "can be created with an empty array" do
  bill = Bill.new []

  expect(bill).must_be_instance_of Bill
end
```

#### How to make it pass?

That's easy!  It **already** passes!

#### Question
What else could we do for invalid arguments to `initialize`?

### Practice Exercise

Now we need make a method that calculates the bill subtotal.  Write a test (`it` block) that creates an instance of Bill, calls a `subtotal` method and ensure that it returns the correct answer (the sum of the prices).  You can use the `must_equal` matcher.

Then make the test pass by editing `bill.rb`

#### Check & Verify

Check with your neighbor.  You can find a solution [here for the test](https://github.com/AdaGold/bill_calculator/commit/e5bbfe7cd0235e93408e6fae81abf5f2c8624437) [and here for `bill.rb`](https://github.com/AdaGold/bill_calculator/commit/c67fec9271b50fe1d2fd28cf93db343b2dee4f06)

## Arrange-Act-Assert

Notice our example followed a pattern from our earlier [introduction to automated tests](../00-programming-fundamentals/intro-to-automated-tests.md).  First we created a `Bill`, or **arranged** the situation.  Then by calling the `subtotal` method we **acted**, or performed the action we wanted to test.  Lastly we used the expectation to **assert** that the result of our action was correct.    This is a good example of the _Arrange-Act-Assert_ pattern discussed earlier.

### Practice Exercise - Sales Tax

Next we need to add functionality for our class to evaluate sales tax on the bill.  To start we will write a test for a method, `tax`, to calculate the taxes on a bill.  We will for now assume 8% sales tax.

**First Write the Test**

Add another `it` block inside the existing `describe` block, create an instance of `Bill`, and use a matcher to verify that `tax` returns the correct value.  Follow the same arrange-act-assert pattern as above.

Check your solution with a classmate and you can verify your answer [here](https://github.com/AdaGold/bill_calculator/commit/c9a7a2dd28c1f4edce4d9b65a0e9ef206a8ec41d)

**Next Make It Pass**

Then modify `Bill` to make the test pass.

Check your solution with a classmate and you can verify your answer [here](https://github.com/AdaGold/bill_calculator/commit/b2917775a00b5ada7aec8073409dc9278a54582b)


**Question**:  What additional edge cases should you cover?

## Drying Tests

Notice that we are doing `bill = Bill.new ...` a lot!  We can DRY out our code by adding a `before` block inside our `describe`.  `before` blocks are executed **each time** before each `it` executes.  That lets us create an instance variable and use it rather than repeat our **arrange** steps for each test case.

```ruby
describe "Bill" do
  before do
    @bill = Bill.new [4.75, 8.75]
  end

  it "can be created" do
    # the class of @bill should be Bill
    expect(@bill).must_be_instance_of Bill
  end

  ...
```

## Organizing Code

As our projects get larger putting all our code in the same folder gets messy, especially with test files.  So we will be setting up projects like this:

![Project Structure](images/project_folder.png "project structure")

We will be placing our code in the **lib** folder, and our test specs in the **specs** folder.

### Wait What Is This Rakefile Thingy?

[Rake](https://github.com/ruby/rake) is a utility Ruby developers use which lets you set up tasks, like testing and running your programs.  Rake reads the Rakefile and follows the Ruby code in the Rakefile to execute listed tasks.

All we are going to use Rake for now is testing, but later Rake will do all sorts of neat stuff for us.

To install rake please enter:

```bash
gem install rake
```

#### Setting Up

1.  Move your non-testing source code into a folder called `lib`.
1.  Move your testing specs into a folder called `specs`.
1.  Change the **require_relative** line in the spec to point to the lib folder.
1.  Create the following `Rakefile` in the project root directory

```ruby
require 'rake/testtask'

Rake::TestTask.new do |t|
  t.libs = ["lib"]
  t.warning = true
  t.test_files = FileList['specs/*_spec.rb']
end

task default: :test
```

You can now test your code with `$ rake`

```bash
$  rake
Run options: --seed 2866

# Running:

...

Finished in 0.001215s, 2469.1358 runs/s, 3292.1811 assertions/s.

3 runs, 4 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```
Now you can have as many spec files as you want and run all the tests with a single `rake` command.

## Final Exercise

#### Exercise Testing `total` Method

Now write a test for and implement the `Bill#total` method which should return the sum of the subtotal and tax.

After you finish you can check your work with a solution [here](https://github.com/AdaGold/bill_calculator/tree/0e9911c482033bf00cb949407025e96c5afd4dc8).

## Testing Floats

In this walkthrough we are testing floating point numbers for equality.  This [can be dangerous](https://books.google.com/books?id=oRqkBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA73&lpg=PA73&dq=ruby+float+comparison&source=bl&ots=8O2nV1Zjn0&sig=ckve5lVDtS-ff9hPMqhXJlNnaNM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiVvKvL6-zYAhUS-2MKHadID2YQ6AEIUjAE#v=onepage&q=ruby%20float%20comparison&f=false) because floating point numbers are inexact approximations of the real numbers.  In the real-world we would certainly round our floating point numbers to 2 decimals as it represents money and for other comparisons when you use floating point numbers you would use `must_be_within_delta` to ensure that a value is within a certain range of the target number.  For example:  `expect(tax).must_be_within_delta @bill.subtotal * 0.08, 0.01`, which means it would be within 0.01 of the given value.

The big take-away is to never compare floats for exact values.  Instead use `must_be_within_delta`, or round to a specific number of digits.

## List of Minitest Matchers

|   Matcher	|   Example	|   What it does	|   	Negation |
|---	|---	|---	|---	|
|   `must_equal`	|   `expect(obj1).must_equal obj2`	|   The test succeeds if the object equals the given object.  It fails otherwise.	|   	`wont_equal` |
|   `must_be`	|   `expect(num).must_be :>, 5`	|   It lets you compare the given object to another using a given operator.  In this example num must be greater than 5.	|  `wont_be`  |
|   `must_be_empty`	|   `expect(list).must_be_empty`	|   The test passes if the given collection is empty.	|  `wont_be_empty` |
|   `must_be_instance_of`	|   `expect(@bill).must_be_instance_of Bill`	|   The test passes if the object is an instance of the given class.	|  `wont_be_instance_of`  |
|   `must_be_kind_of`	|   `expect(list).must_be_kind_of Enumerable`	|   The test fails if the object is not a kind of the argument.	| `wont_be_kind_of`  |
|   `must_be_nil`	|   `expect(list).must_be_nil`	|   The test fails if the given object is not nil.	|  `wont_be_nil`   |
|   `must_be_same_as`	|   `expect(list).must_be_same_as another_list`	|   The test fails if the object is not the same as the given argument.	|    `wont_be_same_as`  |
|   `must_be_silent`	|   `expect { obj1.do_something }.must_be_silent`	|   The test fails if the given block outputs something to the terminal (like using puts etc).  	|  `wont_be_silent`   |
|   `must_be_within_delta`	|   	`expect(Math::PI, (22.0 / 7.0)).must_be_within_delta 0.01` |  In the documentation's example: `expect(Math::PI, (22.0 / 7.0)).must_be_within_delta 0.01`, this expectation will pass because 22.0/7 - Math::PI == 0.001264..., which is less than the allowed delta of 0.01.	|  `wont_be_within_delta`  |
|   `must_include`	|   `expect(list).must_include 31`	|   The test fails if the collection does not contain the given value.	|  `wont_include`  |
|   `must_match`	|   `expect(name).must_match /silly/`	|   The test fails if the object doesn't match the given regular expression.	|  `wont_match`  |
|   `must_output`	|   `expect { obj.do_something }.must_output "something"	`|   The test fails if the given block does not output the given value.	|
|   `must_respond_to`	|   `expect(bill).must_respond_to :tax`	|   The test fails if the object does not respond to the given method name.  	|  `wont_respond_to`  |
|   `must_raise`	|   `expect { obj1.do_something }.must_raise NoMethodError`	|   The test fails if the given block does not raise the given exception.	|    |
|   `must_throw` |   	`expect { obj1.do_something }.must_throw Exception` |   	Similar to `must_raise`  You can probably safely ignore this, but you can see [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/51021/what-is-the-difference-between-raising-exceptions-vs-throwing-exceptions-in-ruby) for an explanation on the differences between raise and throw..  | `wont_throw`  |
