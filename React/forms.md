# React Forms

## Learning Goals
- Implement a form in a component
- Handle the event of a form submission in a component
- Dynamically provide user feedback as they complete a form

### Overview
Since we've already learn how event handling works in React, we should be able to take the application of this knowledge one step further to allow us to submit a set of form data. Forms work a bit different than other HTML elements because they maintain some of their own state.

Additionally, one of the most powerful aspects of using any JavaScript framework is to provide some dynamic user interaction. We'll see here how to integrate ongoing user feedback, so the user does not have to wait until the form is submitted to know that they might have issues with the data.
