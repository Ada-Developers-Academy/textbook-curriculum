## Learning Goals
- Use an event handler to handle a change on a component's element
- Modify state via an event handler

### Overview
React supplies support on many different events. We'll focus on a few of the common events, keyboard and click, but just know that you should reference the [full list](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html#supported-events) if you want more information.

### Event Types
Let's start with two common events, `onClick` and `onKeyUp`.
