# Using CSS in React Components

## Learning Goals
- See options for how to include CSS in React components
- Use and load external css files to store CSS data
- Show how to use `const`s and `style` directly in component files to store CSS data


## Raw Notes
- Using `const` vars within the component file itself
- Loading CSS from an external file
- We are NOT going to show how to load in Foundation

## Key Takeaway
While you may seem some examples using the `style` attribute directly on components, we are going to continue putting our styles in eternal style sheets and loading them into components where necessary.
