1.  In the `SignupForm` component, what event handlers do you have?
1.  Is this a controlled form?  What does that mean?
1.  The `email` field isn't working, why?  How do you fix it?
1.  Explain how the text inputs turn pink or green?
1.  How could the `SignupForm` pass a registered user up to the App component on a successful registration?
    a.  Try to add that handler and just console.log the created user.
