## Guided Practice

Let's Create a class called `Animal` with the following instance variables:
  * `type` (i.e. wolf, bear, etc.)
  * `distance_from_home`

Our class will have a couple helper methods. We'll talk together about what these methods do.
  * `travel` 
  * `summary`

Let's build our class and instantiate a few `Animals` to practice what we've learned:
  * the constructor
  * instance methods
  * instance variables
  * attr_reader, attr_writer, attr_accessor
  * self
  * file organization
