# Exercism: Session and Media Ranker

Today we are going to be reviewing Session and discussing the current progress on Media Ranker.

For this discussion, think of your instructor as a mediator and guide, rather than as a lecturer. You are encouraged to do the following:

* Whenever possible, you should use voice.
* You should pose questions to the group, not the instructor.
* Similarly, you are encouraged to answer questions, with the instructor available to correct misconceptions and provide answers when no one else has an answer.
* Say something, even if you think you might be wrong! (Nobody throws a frisbee well on their first try)
* When discussing code, you are encouraged to use VS Code Liveshare, and or screen sharing through zoom.
* Take notes!

## Prompts
You are encouraged to copy these questions into a document and take notes during the discussion.

### Session

1. As a group, come up with a description for how `session` helps with log-in functionality
1. How would our controller tests be affected by log-in functionality?
1. How does someone "clear" the contents of `session`...
    - in our Rails code?
    - in our browser?
1. Share code: If anyone has an example of `session` being used in a controller action (even if it's not working or in-progress), share with the group! Practice talking through your code. Feel free to use this time to ask questions, especially if you don't have `session` working.

### Media Ranker

1. As a group, share with each other what your project's models and controllers are like. What models do your projects have? What are the relationships between these models?
1. Everyone should quickly give a brief update describing where you are in the Media Ranker project. Each person's update should be small and quick and 1-3 sentences, much like a stand-up meeting.
    - What is the most recent line of code you wrote that you're proud of?
    - What is the current or upcoming challenge that you need to tackle next?
1. What questions and help would you like to ask others about the project?

### Heroku

1.  What purpose does Heroku serve?
1.  Who has tried to deploy a Rails application to Heroku?
  - Did you encounter any issues?
  - What actions did you have to do after `git push heroku master`   Why?
  - Why does the Heroku instance have different data than localhost?
