# Exercism: Roman Numerals & Ride Share Rails

Today we are going to be discussing the solution to the assigned Exercism problem, and the progress on Ride Share Rails. 

For this discussion, think of your instructor as a mediator and guide, rather than as a lecturer. You are encouraged to do the following:

* Whenever possible, you should use voice.
* You should pose questions to the group, not the instructor.
* Similarly, you are encouraged to answer questions, with the instructor available to correct misconceptions and provide answers when no one else has an answer.
* Say something, even if you think you might be wrong! (Nobody throws a frisbee well on their first try)
* When discussing code, you are encouraged to use VS Code Liveshare, and or screen sharing through zoom.
* Take notes!

## Materials
* Exercism: Roman Numerals
* [Ride Share Rails](https://github.com/Ada-C13/ride-share-rails)

## Prompts
You are encouraged to copy these questions into a document and take notes during the discussion.

### Exercism

1. At least two folks should show or talk through their solution of Exercism: Roman Numerals. These two people should be people who have not shared their solution to an Exercism problem before.
    - While people are demoing their solution, those who are watching should be thinking of:
        - at least one question about the code
        - at least one thing that they like about the code

### Ride Share Rails

1. Everyone should quickly give a brief update describing where you and your team is in the Ride Share Rails project. Each person's update should be small and quick and 1-3 sentences, much like a stand-up meeting.
    - What is the most recent line of code you and your team wrote that you're proud of?
    - What is the current or upcoming challenge that you and your team need to tackle next?
1. What questions and help would you like to ask other groups about the project? What questions and help do you need before project submission?
