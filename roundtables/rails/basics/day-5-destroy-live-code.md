# Destroy Live Code; HTTP verbs and Migrations and REST, oh my!

## Live Code

Today is going to be a little bit different than normal. We're going to do a live code on how to write up the Rails destroy action in Ada Books!

Hopefully this is illuminating.  This will serve as the video lesson on destroy (and will be recorded).

## Discussion

For the discussion portion of the roundtable we're going to cover the 5 HTTP verbs, Active Record migrations and Rails's RESTful routes.

For this discussion, think of your instructor as a mediator and guide, rather than as a lecturer. You are encouraged to do the following:

* Whenever possible, you should use voice.
* You should pose questions to the group, not the instructor.
* Similarly, you are encouraged to answer questions, with the instructor available to correct misconceptions and provide answers when no one else has an answer.
* Say something, even if you think you might be wrong! (Nobody throws a frisbee well on their first try)
* When discussing code, you are encouraged to use VS Code Liveshare, and or screen sharing through zoom.
* Take notes!

### Prompts
You are encouraged to copy these questions into a document and take notes during the discussion.

#### Popcorn Style Discussions

Because this week is very definition heavy We're going to do the first three points here "popcorn" style.  Once someone volunteers to start they will explain one bullet point and then say "popcorn #{NAME}" and that next person will cover the next point.

Please try to popcorn to people that haven't already shared much so things move around.

##### What if I don't want to talk?

That's fine!  Just say "popcorn #{DIFFERENT_NAME}" right away.

1. Describe the 5 HTTP verbs "popcorn" style and explain how it relates to CRUD (create, read, update and delete):
    1. `GET`
    2. `POST`
    3. `PATCH`
    4. `PUT`
    5. `DELETE`
2. Describe the methods we use to write Active Record Migrations "popcorn" style:
    1. `create_table`
    2. `add_column`
    3. `remove_column`
    4. `change_column`
    5. `rename_column`
3. Describe Rails's Seven "RESTful Routes" again "popcorn" style:
    1. `index`
    2. `new`
    3. `create`
    4. `show`
    5. `edit`
    6. `update`
    7. `destroy`
4. Do you have any questions about Task List?  Are you stuck anywhere?  Share your code and get help!
