# Creating APIs, Video Store API

Today we are going to be reviewing APIs in Rails, and discussing the current progress on Video Store API.

For this discussion, think of your instructor as a mediator and guide, rather than as a lecturer. You are encouraged to do the following:

* Whenever possible, you should use voice.
* You should pose questions to the group, not the instructor.
* Similarly, you are encouraged to answer questions, with the instructor available to correct misconceptions and provide answers when no one else has an answer.
* Say something, even if you think you might be wrong! (Nobody throws a frisbee well on their first try)
* When discussing code, you are encouraged to use VS Code Liveshare, and or screen sharing through zoom.
* Take notes!

## Prompts
You are encouraged to copy these questions into a document and take notes during the discussion.

### Making an API in Rails

1. As a group, come up with a list of differences between making a full-stack web app with Rails vs. making a back-end API with Rails
1. What are the differences between testing a web app vs. testing a Rails API?

### Video Store API

1. As a group, share with each other what your project's models and controllers are like. What models do your projects have? What are the relationships between these models?
1. Everyone should quickly give a brief update describing where you and your team are in the Video Store API project. Each person's update should be small and quick and 1-3 sentences, much like a stand-up meeting.
    - What is the most recent line of code you wrote that you're proud of?
    - What is the current or upcoming challenge that you need to tackle next?
1. What questions and help would you like to ask others about the project?
