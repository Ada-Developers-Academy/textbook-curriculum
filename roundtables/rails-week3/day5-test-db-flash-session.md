# Exercism: The Test Database, Flash, and Session

Today we are going to be discussing the following concepts in Rails: The Test Database, Flash, and Session

For this discussion, think of your instructor as a mediator and guide, rather than as a lecturer. You are encouraged to do the following:

* Whenever possible, you should use voice.
* You should pose questions to the group, not the instructor.
* Similarly, you are encouraged to answer questions, with the instructor available to correct misconceptions and provide answers when no one else has an answer.
* Say something, even if you think you might be wrong! (Nobody throws a frisbee well on their first try)
* When discussing code, you are encouraged to use VS Code Liveshare, and or screen sharing through zoom.
* Take notes!

## Prompts
You are encouraged to copy these questions into a document and take notes during the discussion.

### The Test Database

1. What is the test database, and how is it different from the development database (the database accessed when running the Rails server and visiting `localhost:3000`)?
1. What is the relationship between fixtures and the test database?
1. In Media Ranker, how will the test database be used? Use concrete and specific examples when possible.

### Flash

1. As a group, come up with a definition for `flash` in your own words
1. As a group, come up with a definition for `flash.now` in your own words. How does it differ from `flash` in syntax and use case?
1. In Media Ranker, how will `flash` be used?
1. Share code: If anyone has an example of `flash` being used in a controller action (even if it's not working or in-progress), share with the group! Practice talking through your code. Feel free to use this time to ask questions, especially if you don't have `flash` working.

### Session

1. As a group, come up with a definition for `session` in your own words, and how it helps with log-in functionality
1. As a group, come up with a description for how `session` helps with log-in functionality
1. How would our controller tests be affected by log-in functionality?
1. How does someone "clear" the contents of `session`...
    - in our Rails code?
    - in our browser?
1. Share code: If anyone has an example of `session` being used in a controller action (even if it's not working or in-progress), share with the group! Practice talking through your code. Feel free to use this time to ask questions, especially if you don't have `session` working.
