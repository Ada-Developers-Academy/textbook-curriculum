# Javascript Syntax

Today we are going to be discussing JS Adagrams in a round table fashion. For this discussion, think of your instructor as a mediator and guide, rather than as a lecturer.

For this activity, you are encouraged to do the following:

* Whenever possible, you should use voice.
* You should pose questions to the group, not the instructor.
* Similarly, you are encouraged to answer questions, with the instructor available to correct misconceptions and provide answers when no one else has an answer.
* Say something, even if you think you might be wrong! (Nobody throws a frisbee well on their first try)
* When discussing code, you are encouraged to use VS Code Liveshare, and or screen sharing through zoom.
* Take notes!

## Prompts
You are encouraged to copy these questions into a document and take notes during the discussion.

* Now that you've had a chance to practice functions as a part of JS Adagrams, what new questions or sticking points have you come across?

* In the context of JS Adagrams, what new questions have emerged around Jest and testing?

* What questions do you have about the project instructions, now that you have had time to look at and start work?

* How have you approached structuring data for Wave 1 of JS Adagrams? How has your data structure ensured a weighted distribution (that is, how did you make sure you are more likely to draw and A than a Z)?

* How has approaching Wave 2 compared to Adagrams in Ruby? Is there anything about Javascript that makes the problem easier or harder?
