# Exercism (Hamming) and JS Adagrams

Today we are going to be discussing the Hamming Exercism and any last JS Adagrams questions in a round table fashion. For this discussion, think of your instructor as a mediator and guide, rather than as a lecturer.

For this activity, you are encouraged to do the following:

* Whenever possible, you should use voice.
* You should pose questions to the group, not the instructor.
* Similarly, you are encouraged to answer questions, with the instructor available to correct misconceptions and provide answers when no one else has an answer.
* Say something, even if you think you might be wrong! (Nobody throws a frisbee well on their first try)
* When discussing code, you are encouraged to use VS Code Liveshare, and or screen sharing through zoom.
* Take notes!
