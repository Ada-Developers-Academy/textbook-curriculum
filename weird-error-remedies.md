###### Error Message:
>PG::ConnectionBad could not connect to server Is the server running on host **something** and accepting
TCP/IP connections on port **something**?


###### Solution:
This may be caused by a mismatch of versions between the database and the current version of postgres.
```
brew services list

//check the plist for postgres for the logfile path usually found at
less /usr/local/var/log/postgres.log

//if the log says we have a newer version of postgres you can check to see what the right way to update the database is by checking
brew info postgresql

//look in caveats for migration instructions. currently: 
brew postgresql-upgrade-database
```
