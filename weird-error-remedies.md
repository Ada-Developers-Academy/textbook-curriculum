###### Sauces:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14225038/postgresql-adapter-pg-could-not-connect-to-server
  

###### Error Message:
>PG::ConnectionBad could not connect to server Is the server running on host **something** and accepting
TCP/IP connections on port **something**?


###### Solution:
This may be caused by a mismatch of versions between the database and the current version of postgres.
```
brew services list

//check the plist for postgres for the logfile path usually found at
less /usr/local/var/log/postgres.log

//if the log says we have a newer version of postgres you can check to see what the right way to update the database is by checking
brew info postgresql

//look in caveats for migration instructions. currently: 
brew postgresql-upgrade-database
```


### Heroku Using `GET` rather than `POST`

###### Error Message:
"The page you are looking for doesn't exist"

###### Solution:
This is what the problem looks like:
```
/app/assets/javascripts/application.js

// Read Sprockets README (https://github.com/rails/sprockets#sprockets-directives) for details
// about supported directives. //= require jquery3
  //= require popper
  //= require bootstrap-sprockets
```
There is a missing newline. Corrected code looks like this:
```
/app/assets/javascripts/application.js

// Read Sprockets README (https://github.com/rails/sprockets#sprockets-directives) for details
// about supported directives. 
  //= require jquery3
  //= require popper
  //= require bootstrap-sprockets
```

**However, the problem is in the .rails-template**
```
.rails-template.rb
inject_into_file "app/assets/javascripts/application.js", after: "// about supported directives.\n" do
```
add the newine after `// about supported directives.`
