# CS Fundamentals rough schedule
Below is the rough outline of what we will be covering in CS Fundamentals. Some conversations may spill into the next CS Fundamentals' session.
- A comprehensive list of essential homework assignments may be found [here](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/textbook-curriculum/blob/master/04-cs-fundamentals/homeworks.md).
- A lot of the curriculum content is in slide decks. All CS Fundamentals slide decks may be found [here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B__DV26QHsH4RXM5ZXlneHlCWnc). Please present the slide deck to see the animations render and avoid seeing the answers before reading the question.
- See pinned posts on the cs-fundamentals Slack channel in your cohort to see other useful links.
