# Introduction Linked Lists
## Learning Goals
  + Understand structure of Linked Lists
  + Understand pros and cons of linked lists when compared to arrays
  + Types of Linked List
    + Singly linked list
    + Doubly linked list
  + Basic manipulation on a singly linked list
    + Add a value (i.e. node with a value)
    + Search for a value
    + Delete a value (i.e. node with a value)
    + Count number of nodes in the linked list

## Notes
Please see the slide deck linked at the bottom

## Exercises
Here's the exercises we'll cover in class.
1. Add a node to a singly linked list
2. Search for a value in a singly linked list
3. Delete a node from a singly linked list
4. Count number of nodes in the linked list

## Assignment
Create .rb file and define the Linked List and Node classes keeping object oriented principles in mind. Author methods to add a value, search for a value, count the number of entries and delete a value from the linked list, assuming that the values in each nodes are integers. Be mindful of when the linked list is empty (before adding the first node, after deleting the last node etc.) in your methods.</br>
Do the above for a singly linked list and a separate file for a doubly linked list.
