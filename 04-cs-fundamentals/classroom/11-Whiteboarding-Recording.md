## Examples of things you are looking for in your recorded playback
- Is your writing legible?
- Do you block the write board when you talk?
- Do you have long pauses? Or are they shorter in playback than they are in your head?
- Do you appear confident?
- How is your eye contact and demeanor?
- Do you mumble?
- Do you talk to the whiteboard or the interviewer?
- Are you unecessarily appologizing?
- Are you saying things like "I don't know where this is going" instead of something like "I might rethink this later, but I'll start here"?
- Are you using technical describing words appropriately or are you saying a lot of "this", "that", etc?
- Are you making any weird faces?
