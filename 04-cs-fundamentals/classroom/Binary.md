# Introduction to Binary & Memory
## Learning Goals
+ Understand binary
  + Convert from binary to decimal
  + Convert from decimal to binary
+ In the context of computer memory, understand
  + Bits
  + Bytes
  + How data is stored in memory
  + High level computer organization: CPU, Main memory & Bus

## Notes
+ There's no homework due before we meet for class. We'll chat about homework due after class during class time.
+ For most CS Fundamentals sessions, we'll observe a closed laptop policy. Please bring along a notebook/papers and pen/pencil to every class. 

## Essential Reading:
Here's some good follow up reading/viewing for after we meet in class:
  + [Computer Data Basics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g-Dxn1rVTChBs9ZZSOgmohjP_RoWNyPJTE-m_n35aZ0/edit)
  + [Video: Understand how memory addressing works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0Ri2TpRBBg)

## Exercises
Here's the exercises we'll cover in class
1. Devise an algorithm to accept 8 binary digits from a user. Convert this eight-digit binary number to decimal number using the approach we learned in class.
2. Calculate the decimal equivalent for these binary numbers: 453, 49, 234, 432
3. Calculate the binary equivalent for these decimal numbers: 1101, 0101, 1001, 1010, 1111, 11000011

## Assignments
Assignments are expected to be worked on after the class discussion and due before the next class.
Fork, clone and complete the assignments below.
1. Author a method based on the binary to decimal algorithm you devised in class. Read further on [Ada-C9/BinaryAndDecimal](https://github.com/Ada-C9/BinaryAndDecimal)
2. Determines if the two input integer arrays are equal. The two arrays will be considered equal if they both have the exact same count of elements in the exact same order. Do this without using Ruby methods (except retrieving the value at an index in the Array, comparing two values at a particular index and a method to determine the length of the Array.)
