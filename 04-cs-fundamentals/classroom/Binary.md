# Introduction to Binary & Memory
## Required work before this class
Before this first CS Fundamentals class, please read, view and complete the exercises on the following links:
  + [Essential Mathematics for Software Engineers](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/textbook-curriculum/blob/master/04-cs-fundamentals/classroom/Essential%20Mathematics.md)
  + [Computer Data Basics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g-Dxn1rVTChBs9ZZSOgmohjP_RoWNyPJTE-m_n35aZ0/edit)
  + [Video: Understand how memory addressing works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0Ri2TpRBBg) by Prof. Abelardo Pardo, University of Sydney
If you have any questions, please email or slack your instructor.

## Learning Goals
+ High level understanding of binary
+ Algorithm to convert from binary to decimal and vice versa
+ High level overview of memory organization on computers
  + Bits
  + Bytes
  + Computer organization: CPU-memory-buses
  + Memory address


## Assignments
Assignments are expected to be worked on after the class discussion and due before the next class.
Fork, clone and complete the assignments below by submitting a pull request:
1. Author a method based on the binary to decimal algorithm you devised in class. Read further on [Ada-C10/BinaryAndDecimal](https://github.com/Ada-C10/BinaryAndDecimal)
2. Determines if the two input integer arrays are equal. The two arrays will be considered equal if they both have the exact same count of elements in the exact same order. Do this without using Ruby methods (except retrieving the value at an index in the Array, comparing two values at a particular index and a method to determine the length of the Array.) Read further on [Ada-C10/array_equals](https://github.com/Ada-C10/array_equals)
- [Optional] Write a program to print all possible values that can be represented using 4 bits. e.g. 0000, 0001, 0010, 0011, 0100 ... and so on.
- [Optional] Understand pros and cons of organizing data in different structures. See assignment on [Ada-C10/array_or_hash](https://github.com/Ada-C10/array_or_hash).
