# Array data structure, Introduction to efficiency of algorithms

## Pre-requisite
Before this lesson, you should have gotten familiar with:
- [Essential mathematics for software engineers](Essential Mathematics.md)
- [Computer basics and binary](Binary.md)

## Learning Goals
+ Arrays – as a data structure
  + How Array data structure or (native) arrays or arrays in strongly typed languages differ from objects of Ruby’s Array class
  + Algorithms related to Array data structure on unsorted and sorted data
    + Compute length given termination character
    + Search for a value
    + Find largest value
    + Find smallest value
    + Reverse an array
+ Introduction to Efficiency of Algorithms
  + Why we care about it
  + What do we care about: Time & Space
  + How to deduce efficiency and compare two algorithmic solutions to the same problem.


## Exercises
Here's the exercises we'll cover in class.
Given an array data structure holding only integer values, device an algorithm for the following exercises.
1. Compute the length of the array, given that the array is terminated by `nil` i.e. `array[length] = nil`.
2. Return the value at index k, such that 0 <= k < length.
3. <strong>Linear Search</strong> Search for a given integer value in the unsorted array. Return true if the value is found in the array. Return false otherwise.
4. Return the maximum (or minimum) integer value in the unsorted array.
5. Return the maximum (or minimum) integer value in a sorted array.
6. <strong>Binary Search</strong> Search for a given integer value in a sorted array. Return true if the value is found in the array. Return false otherwise.
7. Reverse the elements in the array in place.
