# Sorting Review

1.  Look at the [textbook curriculum](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/textbook-curriculum/blob/master/04-cs-fundamentals/classroom/Sorting.md) implementations of BubbleSort (there are two). 
    1.  What is the difference between the two implementations?
    2.  Does one have a practical advantage?
    3.  Does it change the time complexity?
2.  Explain in human terms what SelectionSort does.
    1.  What is it's time complexity?
3.  How is InsertionSort different from SelectionSort?
4.  Is MergeSort better than the other sorts? 
    1.  If so why, if not, why not?
    2.  At a high-level explain what mergesort does.
