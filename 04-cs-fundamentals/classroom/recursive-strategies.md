# Recursive Programming Strategies

In this lesson we will look at some programming strategies, Divide & Conquer and Dynamic programming, and how they can be used to solve recursive problems.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this less you should be able to:

- Explain what a divide & conquer solution is
- Write some divide & conquer solutions
- Explain the concept of dynamic programming
- Explain the concept of memoization
- Use dynamic programming to optimize programming solutions

## Divide & Conquer

### Example:  Binary Search

### Example:  MergeSort

## Dynamic Programming

### Fibonacci
