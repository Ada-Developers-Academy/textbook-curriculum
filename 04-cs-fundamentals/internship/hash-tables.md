# Introduction to Hash Tables

## Learning Goals

By the end of this lesson you should be able to:

  - _separate chaining_
  - _quadratic probing_
  - _double hashing_
- Use a hash table to solve a coding problem
- Choose between a hash table, binary search tree, linked list or array to solve a programming problem.
