# Hash Tables Review

1.  Suppose you were asked to build a hash table data structure for a new language.
    1.  Your collegue proposes converting any given key into a string and then adding all the bytes together for the index in the internal array.  Is this a good hashing function?
    2.  Why or why not?
2.  Why is it important to get the hash function right for a hash table?
3.  Explain what the term _hashing_ means in general.
4.  Hash tables do have a literal worst-case O(n) for insertion and lookup, why is the practical lookup and insertion O(1)?
