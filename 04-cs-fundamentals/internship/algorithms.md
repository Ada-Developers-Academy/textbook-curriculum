# Introduction to Algorithms

## Learning Goals

By the end of this lesson you should be able to:

- Further explain time and space complexity
- Explain the term algorithm
- Explain two categories of algorithms _greedy_ and _divide and conquer_

## What is an an algorithm

### Algorithms areas of study


**Question**

Now that hardware is so cheap and powerful and now that we have enormous cloud computing providers like AWS, is it worth wasting a programmer's valuable time trying to shave off seconds from the runtime of an algorithm?

## Analyzing Algorithms

### Binary Search Trees

### Mergesort

## Categories of Algorithms

### Divide & Conquer

### Greedy

### Dynamic Programming
