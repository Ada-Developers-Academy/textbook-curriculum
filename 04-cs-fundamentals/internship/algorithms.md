## What is an an algorithm

So what is an algorithm?  An _algorithm_ is a finite set of instructions that, if followed, accomplishes a particular task.  You can think of it as a series of steps to accomplish a task.  For example Google maps has an algorithm to calculate the best route to drive between any two points on map.  

All algorithms must have:

- Input
  - An Algorithm may accept zero or more inputs
- Output
  - An algorithm should produce some result
- Clarity
  - Each step in an algorithm should be a clear and unabigouous
- Finiteness
  - An algorithm should end after a finite number of steps. 
  - An algorithm cannot repeat forever (otherwise it doesn't solve a problem)
- Effectiveness
  - It should be possible for a person or computer to fulfill each step in an algorithm and the algorithm should accomplish the given task.

The art of computer science is really the art of devising, analyzing, proving the correctness and testing algorithms.

### Algorithms areas of study



**Question**

Now that hardware is so cheap and powerful and now that we have enormous cloud computing providers like AWS, is it worth wasting a programmer's valuable time trying to shave off seconds from the runtime of an algorithm?
