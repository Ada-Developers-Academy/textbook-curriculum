# Trees
## Learning Goals
Get familiar with Binary Search Trees and the following algorithms related to it
+ Search
+ Insert value
+ Delete value
+ Find height
+ Depth first traversals: pre-order, in-order, post-order
+ Breadth first traversal

We'll be covering BSTs in two parts. In the first session, we'll cover the recursive approach. In a later session, we'll cover the iterative approach.

## Required
Revise what you've already learned in the CS Fundamentals classroom curriculum:
+ [Understanding function calls](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/textbook-curriculum/blob/master/04-cs-fundamentals/classroom/Understanding%20function%20calls.md) and [Introduction to Recursion](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/textbook-curriculum/blob/master/04-cs-fundamentals/classroom/Introduction%20to%20Recursion.md)
+ Revise or author exercises related to recursion. See [Assignments and Additional Resources for Recursion](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/textbook-curriculum/blob/master/04-cs-fundamentals/classroom/Introduction%20to%20Recursion.md#assignments)
+ Before going through iterative approaches to BST algorithms, revise [Stacks and Queues](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/textbook-curriculum/blob/master/04-cs-fundamentals/internship/Stacks%20and%20Queues.md)

## Exercises
Design a recursive algorithm, deduce the space and time complexity and then, author functions to do the following. For each of the problems below, assume you are given a Binary Search Tree where each node contains an integer data and links to the left and right children nodes.
  1. Search for a given integer value in the Binary Search Tree. Return true if the value is found, false otherwise.
  2. Insert a given integer value in the Binary Search Tree.
  3. Compute the height of the Binary Search Tree.
  4. Print values in the Binary Search Tree in pre-order.
  5. Print values in the Binary Search Tree in in-order.
  6. Print values in the Binary Search Tree in post-order.
  7. Print values in the Binary Search Tree in level-order. (Breadth-first traversal)
  8. Delete a given value from the Binary Search Tree.

Design an iterative algorithm for the first seven exercises above, deduce the space and time complexity and author the functions to implement them. You may use additional data structures.

## Optional offline Problem Sets
+ Convert a given integer array e.g. {5,2,1,6,7,3,4} to a Binary Search Tree.
+ Find the height of a BST using an iterative solution.
+ Given 2 Binary Trees (not BST), return true if both trees have the same in-order else return false. Note: You can save in-order from both trees and compare in the end (try implementing this as well). Can you inorder traverse them parallely and stop the traversal on a mismatch to return false instead?
