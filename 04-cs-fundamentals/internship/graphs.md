## Terms & Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|--- |--- |
| Graph | A data structure with two parts:  A limited set of verticies, called nodes, and a limited set of connections between nodes known as edges. |
| Edge | A connection between two nodes in a graph |
| Node | The fundamental unit of a graph in computer science.  Each element of a graph, connected by edges. |
