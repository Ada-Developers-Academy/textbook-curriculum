    - 1. Walk through a problem as a class
    - 1. Give time to discuss hw solutions with a partner/group
    - 1. After some time (~20-30 min), check in and walk through another problem or two as a class. Ask students to present their work.
- New Content (This is the content the class learned about in the video lesson they watched in the past week)
    - 1. Review content from video as a class (using PP - if available)
        - Should focus on students demonstrating knowledge, not teacher conveying new information
    - 1. Give time to work on the homework
    - 1. Check in and go over a couple answers as a class
    - 1. Independent work time (students are free to go)
