# Queue
In this section, we'll be implementing a queue using object oriented design principles. You're encouraged to create a class and code to follow along. 

## Tests
To make our design and implementation follow a test-driven design and development approach, let's begin with thinking about how we will create an instance of the Queue class and call methods on it.

<b>Exercise</b>:Take some time to write the code for doing the following:
1. Create an instance of the `Queue` class
1. Check whether the queue is empty
1. Check whether the queue is full
1. Enqueue the integer value 10 to the queue
1. Check whether the queue is empty
1. Enqueue the integer value 20 to the queue
1. Check whether the queue is empty
1. Enqueue the integer value 30 to the queue
1. Check whether the queue is empty
1. Dequeue an item from the queue and verify that it is of value 10
1. Dequeue an item from the queue and verify that it is of value 20
1. Dequeue an item from the queue and verify that it is of value 30
1. Check whether the queue is empty
