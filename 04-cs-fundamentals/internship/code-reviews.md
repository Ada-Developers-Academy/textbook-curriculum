# Code Reviews

## Learning Goals

By the end of this lesson you should be able to:

- Explain the purposes of a code review
- Use Github Pull Requests to provide feedback on a code review
- Practice giving feedback on a PR

## What Is A Code Review?

A Code Review is a process in which one or more developers review code written by another developer as part of the quality assurance process.  This is usually done before changes are merged into production and is done by reading the source code and providing comments and suggestions.  The people checking and commenting are called _Reviewers_.

## Why Do Code Reviews?

Code reviews provide the following benefits.

- **Readability & Consistent Style** - By ensuring that code is reviewed before it is merged into the main project, team members can ensure that the code is understandable by others beyond the author and adheres to coding standards that the team has adopted.
- **Knowledge Transfer** - When a team makes code reviews part of the development process they ensure that knowledge of each feature is shared among multiple members of the team.  
  - This minimizes disruption when a member transfers, finds new employment, retires etc.  
  - It also makes it easier for other team members to adapt or adjust the feature under review in the future.
  - Code reviews provide a useful tool for newer team members to explore and learn about the codebase.  That said, a new team member should **not** be the only reviewer.
  - Finally this allows developers to learn techniques, libraries and tricks from other members of the team.
- **Architecture** - By involving several team members in a proposed change or feature a code review allows the team to examine the architecture of a feature and judge it in the larger context of the application.  Will the change scale?  Does it match or integrate with the architecture of the larger application.
- **Finding Bugs** - As you might expect, having more eyes on code early in development allows the team to catch more bugs **before** they enter production, lowering costs and speeding up development time.  

## Types Of Code Reviews

There are several different ways to review code.

### Pull Requests

### Pair Programming

### Mob Programming

## Egoless Programming

Tips for success
- Code & Functional Reviews (TODO: Look up functional reviews)
- Get a 3rd opinion
- Keep changes small (small branches)
- Don't trust the dev, challenge them
- Use your fav tool (TODO: look up PR review in VS Code)
- Shared vision
