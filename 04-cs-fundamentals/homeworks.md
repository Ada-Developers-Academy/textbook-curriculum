  2. Check if the linked list contains a node with specified input value. Returns true if found, false otherwise.
  3. Return the max value in the linked list. Returns the data value and not the node. (Assume that the data is an integer value).
  4. Return the min value in the linked list. Returns the data value and not the node. (Assume that the data is an integer value).
  5. Return the count of nodes in the singly linked list.

  8. Print the value of each node in the singly linked list separated by a space.

1. Implement a Stack using a linked list to hold integer data (implement push(e) and pop() method)
1. Implement a Queue using an array to hold integer data (implement enqueue() and dequeue(e) method)
1. Implement a Queue using a linked list to hold integer data (implement enqueue() and dequeue(e) method)
1. Add the following functions to each of the above:
    * Empty() which returns true is the data structure is empty, false otherwise
    * Size() which returns the number of items in the data structure
    * Front() which returns the item that would be dequeued next (for Queue)
