## Optional Homeworks
### Binary & Decimal
1. Code: Write a program to print all possible values that can be represented using 4 bits. e.g. 0000, 0001, 0010, 0011, 0100 ... and so on.
2. Calculate the decimal equivalent for these binary numbers: 453, 49, 234, 432
3. Calculate the binary equivalent for these decimal numbers: 1101, 0101, 1001, 1010, 1111, 11000011
4. Understand pros and cons of organizing data in different structures. See assignment on [Ada-C10/array_or_hash](https://github.com/Ada-C10/array_or_hash).

### Linked Lists
1. Create .rb file and define the Linked List and Node classes keeping object oriented principles in mind. Author methods to add a value, search for a value, count the number of entries and delete a value from the linked list, assuming that the values in each nodes are integers. Be mindful of when the linked list is empty (before adding the first node, after deleting the last node etc.) in your methods.</br>
2. Do the above for a singly linked list and a separate file for a doubly linked list.

### Recursion
1. Design and implement recursive algorithms and explain the time and space complexities of your solution for the problems in [Ada-C10/recursion-writing](https://github.com/Ada-C10/recursion-writing). One approach to implementing the solutions can be found [here](https://github.com/Ada-C9/recursion-writing/tree/solution)
2. [Set 1: Practice question for Recursion](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/practice-questions-for-recursion/)
3. [Set 2: Practice question for Recursion](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/practice-questions-for-recursion-set-2/)
4. [Set 3: Practice question for Recursion](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/practice-questions-for-recursion-set-3/)
5. [Set 4: Practice question for Recursion](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/practice-questions-for-recursion-set-4/)
6. [Set 5: Practice question for Recursion](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/practice-questions-for-recursion-set-5/)
7. [Set 6: Practice question for Recursion](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/practice-questions-for-recursion-set-6/)
8. [Set 7: Practice question for Recursion](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/practice-questions-for-recursion-set-7/)

### Stacks and Queues
1. Implement a Stack using an array to hold integer data
2. Implement a Stack using a linked list to hold integer data
3. Implement a Queue using an array to hold integer data
4. Implement a Queue using a linked list to hold integer data
5. Add the following functions to each of the above:
-- Empty() which returns true is the data structure is empty, false otherwise
-- Size() which returns the number of items in the data structure
-- Front() which returns the item that would be dequeued next (for Queue) 
-- Top() which returns the item that would be popped next  (for Stack)
-- Min() which returns the minimum integer data value in the data structure
-- Max() which returns the maximum integer data value in the data structure
6. Write a function to print all integer values in a binary tree in pre-order traversal iteratively. (Hint: Use a Stack.)
7. Write a function to print all integer values in a binary tree in breadth first traversal iteratively. (Hint: Use a Queue.)
8. Implement a Queue using 2 Stacks. (Note: it may not be possible to achieve constant time complexity for both Enqueue and Dequeue.)
9. Implement a Stack using 2 Queues. (Note: it may not be possible to achieve constant time complexity for both Push and Pop.)

### Binary Search Trees
1. Create a Binary Search Tree class and define methods. Create one version with recursive methods. Create another version with iterative methods. Explain the time and space complexity of the methods.

### Interview practice problems
1. Submit PR for [Ada-C10/encode_repeating](https://github.com/Ada-C10/encode_repeating)
2. Submit PR for [Ada-C10/digit_match](https://github.com/Ada-C10/digit_match)
