# Ruby to JavaScript Worksheet
Read the code in each section, then write the equivalent JavaScript code for the Ruby that is given. Start by writing it out in a text editor or on a piece of paper. Then try running it and tweak your code until it successfully runs with expected output.

Each problem stands alone. Variables from previous problems do not exist.
