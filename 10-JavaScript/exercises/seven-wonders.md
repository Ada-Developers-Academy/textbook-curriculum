# Seven Wonders JavaScript

This project will be very similar to the [Seven Wonders exercise](https://github.com/AdaGold/api-exercise-seven-wonders) we completed when first learning about APIs. The differences are, this time we'll be working in JavaScript, and instead of dumping information to the command line we'll build HTML elements and add them to the DOM.

This is an in-class exercise, and does not require a pull request.

## Learning Goals
By the end of this project, students should be able to...

- Use jQuery and axios to read data from an API in JavaScript
- Parse through an API response in JavaScript and extract desired information
- Add data from an API to a web page

## Details

Given the following array of wonders:

```javascript
seven_wonders = [
  "Great Pyramid of Giza",
  "Hanging Gardens of Babylon",
  "Colossus of Rhodes",
  "Pharos of Alexandria",
  "Statue of Zeus at Olympia",
  "Temple of Artemis",
  "Mausoleum at Halicarnassus"
]
```

Build a web page to display the list of wonders along with their locations. Your page should include an HTML file and a JavaScript file. The JavaScript should take the list of wonders, run them through the Google Maps API, and add a DOM element to the page for each including its name and coordinates.

Feel free to use your Ruby solution as a starting point. The learning goal here is working with axios and rendering the results in a web page, not deciphering the Google Maps API.
