# JavaScript Summary Worksheet

## Learning Objectives

- Review major JavaScript concepts
- Review functions
- Review definitions on asynchronous code and HTTP requests
- Review definitions on Web API
- Review JavaScript syntax

## Group Questions

For the following section, practice the following process with your neighbors:
- Read the question with your neighbors
- Answer it on your own
- Check the answer
- Check-in with your neighbors: Do you or your neighbors have any questions?

1. What is the following code snippet doing?

```javascript
const createCakeLabel = (ingredients) => {
  return `Delicious ${ingredients[0]} Cake üç∞. Ingredients: ${ingredients}`;
}

const groceries = ['strawberries', 'sugar', 'eggs', 'flour', 'cream'];

createCakeLabel(groceries);
```

  First it defines an arrow function `createCakeLabel`. This function takes in one parameter: `ingredients`. It returns a string that interpolates cake type and the ingredients.
  <br/>
  Then it defines a `const` variable `groceries`, which is an array of strings.
  <br/>
  Lastly, it _invokes_ or _calls_ the method `createCakeLabel` and _passes in_ `groceries`

2. The following two code snippets are doing different things. What is the difference?

A:

```javascript
const sayHi = () => {
  return 'hi';
}

const sayLoudGreeting = () => {
  console.log( sayHi().toUpperCase() );
}

sayLoudGreeting();
```

B:

```javascript
const sayHi = () => {
  return 'hi';
}

const sayLoudGreeting = (callGreeting) => {
  console.log( callGreeting().toUpperCase() );
}

sayLoudGreeting( sayHi );
```

  In both, calling `sayGreeting()` calls `console.log`.

  <br>

  In A, in `sayGreeting`, it will `console.log` the evaluation of `sayHi().toUpperCase()`, and it will call `sayHi()` directly. Calling `sayGreeting` does not take in an argument.

  <br>

  In B, in `sayGreeting`, it takes in one parameter: a function named `callGreeting`. In B, we invoke `sayGreeting` with the function `sayHi`. We do not invoke `sayHi` the function at that time. We only invoke `sayHi` when there are parentheses next to it: for example `sayHi()`. `console.log` will log the evaluation of `callGreeting().toUpperCase()`. It does not call `sayHi()`, but instead it calls the function `callGreeting`.

3. How are arrow functions and non-arrow functions similar? How are arrow functions different from non-arrow functions? Do we have a preference for one syntax over the other here at Ada?

<details>

  Arrow functions and non-arrow functions both are valid syntaxes to define functions. They are different in how they look. Also, arrow functions do not have their own `this`. We prefer arrow function syntax at Ada.

4. In what ways have we seen that JavaScript and Ruby are different? In what ways have they been the same?

    There's actually no answer for this one, please just discuss it a little with your neighbors. :)

## Definitions

In groups, find definitions/answers for the following concepts or questions:

1. What is Asynchronous Programming?
1. What does the `then()` and `catch()` syntax mean when we use `axios` to make an HTTP Request?
1. What is Event-Driven Programming? What does event handling mean?
1. What is Web API?
1. What is the DOM?
1. What is a single page application?

## JavaScript Syntax

1. Reduce this function to a minimal arrow function:

```js
const divisibleByThree = function(num) {
  return num % 3 === 0;
};
```

2. Convert the Ruby sample code into JavaScript

```ruby
def coffee_price is_iced, size, flavor_array
  price = 2.50

  if size == 0
  elsif size == 1
    price += 1
  else
    price *= 2
  end

  if is_iced
    price += 0.75
  end

  flavor_array.each do |flavor|
    puts "pumping #{flavor}"
    price += 0.50
  end

  price
end

puts coffee_price true, 3, ["vanilla", "lemon"]
```
