# OOD Exercise: Library Book

Fact: Libraries have a lot of books.

If we want to make a program that tracks all the books in a library, we can make the process much more efficient by making a class for a book, much like a template. That way we can more easily make and keep track of all the different books.


## Baseline
#### A book should have:
  - title
  - author
  - description
  - call number
  - year published
  - number of copies available to check-out
  - list of names of people who have checked-out this book
  - list of names of people who currently have book checked-out

#### The book should be able to:
- be checked-out
- be checked-in
- add more copies

## Get to Work!
1. Create a new ruby file
1. Make a class for a library book
1. Have your Book set the appropriate attributes on initialize
1. Create the appropriate reader & writer methods for your class' attributes
1. Have you tested yet? By now you should have made tests that:
    - Can create new instances of your book class
    - Pass in the appropriate attributes when creating the instance
    - Can call the appropriate attributes on an instance
1. Create a custom method for each action a book should be able to do. Make sure to test each method.


#### Tips
- Methods should refrain from using puts, utilize return values as much as possible
- Test after ever new feature
- Commit to git often

## Example Tests
Your code does not have to match these tests exactly. This is only an example of what some of your tests might look like.

```ruby
sorcers_stone = Book.new(
  title: "Harry Potter and the Sorcer's Stone",
  author: "J. K. Rowling",
  description: "Rescued from the outrageous neglect of his aunt and uncle, a young boy with a great destiny proves his worth while attending Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry.",
  call_num: "823.914R797",
  year_published: 1998,
  copies_available: 3,
  checked_out_by: []
)

puts sorcers_stone.title
# will output "Harry Potter and the Sorcer's Stone" in terminal

sorcers_stone.checkout("Dee")
sorcers_stone.checkout("Cedrick")

puts sorcers_stone.checked_out_by
# will output "Dee" and "Cedrick" to the terminal

puts sorcers_stone.copies_available
# will output "1" to the terminal

sorcers_stone.add_copies(3)
puts sorcers_stone.copies_available
# will output "4" to the terminal

sorcers_stone.checkin("Cedrick")
puts sorcers_stone.checked_out_by
# will output "Dee"

puts sorcers_stone.copies_available
# will output "5"
```
