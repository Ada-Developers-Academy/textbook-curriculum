# What is a Retrospective?
Agile (a philosophy and strategy of software development) teams conduct a _retrospective_ after each "sprint" (phases of a project). This is an opportunity to examine how the team is working together. It's a mediated conversation about the process by which the team is accomplishing its tasks and goals.

One of the most common fears people have when first trying a retrospective is that the ritual will become a negative gripe session, interspersed with blame and counter blame. Those can be cathartic, but they won't contribute to learning nor help us improve our classroom experience. We will intercept and counteract those fears with the __Retrospective Prime Directive__:

# Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.

## Our Retros
During the week, whenever it wouldn't disrupt other classroom activities, add your thoughts and observations to the retro board. We will use the four categories below to classify our experiences and things that we want to acknowledge or discuss:

1. Challenges & Opportunities for Improvement
2. Less Of
3. More Of
4. Positive Experiences & Recognition

## Facilitation
My job during retro is to facilitate and moderate the conversation. I'll stop us from getting into the weeds, and do my best to give everyone the same opportunity to be heard. In specific, my job is to:

1. Set the Stage -> organize notes, introduce process
1. Gather Data -> read organized notes, provide context (if necessary), 
1. Generate Insights -> lead discussion, suggest actionable items (if appropriate)
1. Decide What to Do -> Is recognition enough? Is there an action item someone gets?
1. Close the Retrospective -> Respect people's time.
