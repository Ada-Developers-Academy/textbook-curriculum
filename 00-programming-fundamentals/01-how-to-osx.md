# How to OS X: An Ode to Keyboard Shortcuts
The mouse is slow, especially on a laptop. There are *tons* of hotkeys, tricks, and techniques, to make your usage fast and efficient entirely from the keyboard. You will certainly learn many of these during your career, we'll start by learning just a few.

## Keyboard Symbols
- `⌘` (command)
- `⌥` (option/alt)
- `⌃` (control)
- `⇧` (shift)
- `fn` (function)
- `⇥` (tab)
- `↩` (return/enter)
- `␣` (space)

## Hotkeys
### Text Editing
- `⌘s`: save current file
- `⌘c`: copy current selection
- `⌘x`: cut and copy current selection
- `⌘v`: paste last copied content
- `⌘z`: undo last action (can use multiple times)
- `⌘⇧z`: redo last undo

### Cursor & Selection
- `⌘a`: select all contents of current window
- `⌘l`: select current line
- `⌘<directional arrow>`: Move cursor to maximum point in given direction
- `⌥<left or right arrow`: Move cursor one word in either direction
- `⇧<cursor movement command>`: select the content between start and end location of the cursor

### System Navigation
- `⌘w`: close the current tab (window if single tab)
- `⌘⇧w`: close the current window (all tabs)
- `⌘q`: quit the current application
- `⌘⇥`: switch applications, continue to hold `⌘` to display all open programs, each tap on `⇥` will switch to the next app. Use ⇧⇥ to switch to previous app.
- `⌘ backtick`: (backtick is below `esc`), switch windows in the current application, use ⇧ backtick to switch to previous window.
- `⌘␣`: open Spotlight. Spotlight is a tool to search applications, files, and perform some basic function like math and conversions

### Common Application Hotkeys
- `⌘⇧[`: move one tab to the left
- `⌘⇧]`: move one tab to the right
- `⌘⇧t`: open the last closed item
- `⌘f`: find, opens a panel to type a search term
- `⌘⇧f`: find all, searches all files (text editors only, Atom, Sublime)
- `⌘n`: open a new window (or file depending on the application)
- `⌘t`: open a new tab (includes file search in text editors)
- `⌘r`: reload page (Browsers only)
- `⌘,`: open settings pane
- `⌘/`: make selection or line a comment (text editors only)

Hotkeys can be at the system level or specific to a certain application. Not all application will respond to these hotkeys, but the majority that we use (Terminal, major browsers, Atom, Sublime) will.

It takes some practice but after you use these enough, they will become intuitive. Many of the hotkeys I use, I couldn't tell you what they are, my hands just know how to do them.
Resources. Pick top 5 Hotkeys you'd like to use, and force yourself to use them.

Hotkeys can be added or changed under `Keyboard` in the OS X _System Preferences_.
