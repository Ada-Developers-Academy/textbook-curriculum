## Expectations at Ada

At Ada, we actively encourage individuals and teams to use techniques and tools from lo-fi/paper prototyping in order to plan, communicate, and express user flow through a web app. Therefore, we encourage you all to use at most wireframing techniques to draw paper or low-fi prorotypes to explore user-flow and page layout.

Specifically, we think that wireframes help teams get on the same page on:

- routes
- views
- controller actions
- forms and form fields

At Ada, we actively discourage individuals and teams from spending time on high-fidelity wireframes during the classroom portion of the program because of our time constraints, our lower priority on UI/UX development, and our higher priority on web development and implementation code.
