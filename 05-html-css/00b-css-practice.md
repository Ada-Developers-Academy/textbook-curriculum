#Practice Ideas:


- H3 headlines are larger than H1s
- Footer as height set in rems & background color
- Aside text is twice as large as normal
- Header has padding, using rems, and
background color
- P text outside aside is a different font

- H1 headlines change color on hover
- Visited links do not have underlines
- Header is wider than article, both centered
- First letter of link text is bigger
- Footer has a border
- Bonus: make corners of border curved

- Give `<figure>` a solid border (width & color your
choice) and appropriate padding
- Give `<img>` in header 2rem margin top & bottom,
none left & right
- Give `<nav>` a background color and padding
- Apply a border only to top of `<footer>`
