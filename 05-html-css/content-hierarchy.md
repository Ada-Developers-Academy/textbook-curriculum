# Sectioning Elements


## ðŸ“š Learning Goals ðŸ“š
- Can organize content using semantic sectioning tags
- Know why we organize content with semantic sectioning tags

## What are Sectioning Elements
HTML has sectioning elements that allow you to organize your HTML document into logical topical sections.

The pattern of using HTML that describes its content or purpose are called *semantic HTML*. This is opposed to using HTML whose tags or organization do not reflect its content but reflect its presentation. Semantic HTML brings a big advantage for people and programs who need the structure to help them understand the page. These populations include people who use [screen readers](http://webaim.org/techniques/screenreader/) or bots who read through your website.


Below are tags that group elements together.

```html
  <body></body>

  <div></div>

  <section></section>

  <article></article>

  <nav></nav>

  <aside></aside>

  <header></header>

  <footer></footer>

  <main></main>
```
**Think, Pair, Share**
Take some time to research how to use each of the above tags. Then discuss with your neighbor(s). And then high five each other.

## Organize Content with Sectioning Elements
Sectioning elements wrap around the elements we have already been working with. Organizing elements into sectioning elements will also become useful as we start to style the layout of our webpages.

Here are a couple of diagrams of how these sectioning elements might be laid out on a webpage.

## Element Relationships
When elements become nested inside of each other they start to form relationships.
- An element that is inside of another is a _child_ element
- The element wrapping a child is its _parent_
- Elements on the same level as each other are _sibling_ elements

A visual diagram of elements relationships to each other:
![Element Relationship Diagram](imgs/content-hierarchy-diagram.png)

The relationship tree above is modeled from the following code:
```html
<body>
  <header>
    <h1><a href="index.html">Meowspace</a></h1>
  </header>
  <article>
    <h2>You're Meowsome</h2>
    <p>
      Soft kitty warm kitty little ball of furr but hide when guests come over, for gnaw the corn cob purr for no reason. Lies down knock over christmas tree but kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff or massacre a bird in the living room and then look like the cutest and most innocent animal on the planet, and hide head under blanket so no one can see. Kitty power!

  </footer>
</body>
```


### Draw a relationship tree for the HTML code below:
```html
  <body>

    <header>
      <h1>Meowspace</h1>
      <nav>
         <ul>
            <li><a href="#">Login</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">Signup</a></li>
         </ul>
      </nav>
    </header>
    <main>
      <section>
        <h2>Articles</h2>
        <article>
          <header>
            <h3>Everybody Wants to be a Cat</h3>
