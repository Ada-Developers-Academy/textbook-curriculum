# Activity: Empowered Technologists

We should see examples of great leaders who came before us in CS and programming.

Find the list of technologists. Pick a technologist, and find supplies of markers/colored pencils, etc. With a partner, research and find the answers for the following questions:
- Who are they?
- What is their background?
- What have they accomplished?
- Anything else important/interesting to know about them?

Put your findings on the poster. When finished, hang the poster in the classroom. We should now have a full wall of the leaders in tech throughout history!
