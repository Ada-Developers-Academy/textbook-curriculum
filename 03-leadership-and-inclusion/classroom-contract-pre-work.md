# Classroom Contract Pre-Work

It is important, valuable, and exciting for our class to collectively create a shared framework for expectations and behavior in our classroom.

## Reflect

Before we spend some time in class to create a classroom contract, spend some time individually considering your answers to the following prompts:

1. How do you want someone to treat you?
1. How do you want to peers to treat one another?
1. How do you think your peers want to be treated?
1. How should we treat one another when there's a conflict?

## Recall

Think about the best classroom environments that you've been in. What made them special?

## Other Topics to Consider

Imagine your own idea of the ideal classroom environment. For that ideal classroom environment, what are the rules around:

1. Snacks
1. Collaboration
1. Cleanliness
1. Attendance/tardiness
1. Taking breaks

## Ada Still Has a Process

When we form the classroom contract as a group, we'll come up with some classroom values. However, keep in mind that Ada still has official rules and process around conflict resolution, space usage, attendance, among other topics.
