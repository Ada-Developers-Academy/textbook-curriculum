#  Self-Care and Preservation

## Objectives:
 Expand our community conversations to include mental health, neuorodiversity, and well-being. Begin answering the questions: "What happens when we leave Ada? What sustains us internally as we make career transitions?" Move away upper-middle class, consumerist notions of self-care and explore ideas for simple, grounding practices. Create a new definition of self-care together. Create individualized self-care rituals based on our identified needs.

## Container Check-In (10 min)

## Self-Preservation Slide Show Part I (15 min)
  Move through [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10RTJY-HumEbmCl8Iv9CDO5DLwhUab8iS1xExpNNOCZA/edit#slide=id.g17fabdef4d_0_298) 1-4, pausing for conversation about our perceptions or automatic imagery when we hear the phrase "self-care." Challenge these images and discuss self-care that is not just for white, thin, wealthy, straight bodies.

## Individual Reflection on Sustaining/Depleting Behaviors and Environments (15 min)
  Pass out the document in Slide 5 and go over it together. Show my own example in Slide 6 and take questions about goals. Then students will reflect and fill out their own worksheet independently.

## Small Group discussion (15 min)
  In groups of six, have students discuss the 2 questions at the bottom of the worksheet. What themes do they see across both categories (self-soothing, alone time, exercise, friends, etc.)? Do we have the same end goals for both our depleting and sustaining behaviors? Have our themes/goals changed since transitioning to Ada?

## Big Group Follow-Up (15 min)
  List our themes on the white board and discuss common ones.

## Create Individual Self-Care rituals (20 min)
  Pass out blank sheets of paper and display Slide 8. Ask students to look over their themes/the goals of their behaviors and their list of what sustains them. Create a self-care ritual that incorporates these behaviors and speaks to at least two themes. Show my example self-care ritual on Slide 9. I will have baskets with markers and other craft supplies if they want to make their ritual artsy.

## Introduce "Board of Inspiration" (5 min)
  On the tack board in the kitchen area, students can now leave a piece of art, a quote, or something else they think another Adie might Appreciate. If they see something they like, they can take it. If someone doesn't want to keep their self-care ritual but thinks someone else might appreciate, they could leave it there.
