# Interview Week Activities

Interview week is a long week where you are free to manage your time however you'd like, as long as you follow the rules for attendance. However, you may feel like you need some guidance on how to spend your time. The following are activities that are Instructor Endorsedâ„¢ for interview week. These activities are chosen because they are appropriate for where we are in the curriculum:

- Contribute to the Empowered Technologists activity, located in each classroom (see instructors for details, activity detailed [here](./empowered-technologists.md) )
- Review and refresh your personal portfolio site!
- Make a zine around a programming/development process you like or want to practice explaining and getting to know more deeply (see [Julia Evans's "What is a zine?" and zines for inspiration](https://jvns.ca/zines/))
- Remake TaskList (our first Rails project) in React
- Revisit your code journal. Did you write about any actionable items that you didn't get around to before?
- Run through exercises in Ruby or JavaScript in [exercism.io](http://exercism.io/)
- Write a blog post explaining one concept. Start with an idea, then a draft, then find somewhere to post it. Maybe your personal portfolio site?
- Lightning talks. Find some lightning talks to watch with a group, or get together and practice giving lightning talks
- Our library in Ada has some interesting books worth flipping through, too!
