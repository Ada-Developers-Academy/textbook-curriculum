+ This is your journey to be a software engineer.
+ Manage your own learning:
  + Manage your time, know the lessons plan for the week and practice!
  + Leverage the tools available online: Google, Stack Overflow, error messages.
  + Ask questions: 
    + In class, over slack channels, in-person or slack 1-to-1
    + To our teachers, our mentors, our peers and ourselves
+ This is a hard but worth-while journey.
  + Support each other.
  + Intentionally compliment one another during pair projects
  + Be willing to intentionally share struggles and broken code. These are <b>learning moments</b> and not just mistakes.
