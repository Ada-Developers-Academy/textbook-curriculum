# ERD Practice Activity

## Scenario

We are setting up an application to allow people to share their homes to tourists online like AirBnb.  So our initial user stories would be:

- As a user I can add a home to be listed for rentals, along with a price, so I can rent the home out and make money.
- As a user I can choose when a home of mine is available for rentals so I can pick when I can have guests.
- As a user I can can select a home to rent for a vacation on a specific set of dates.
- As a user I can see all the money I have spent.
- As a user with rentals I can see all the money I have made from clients renting my homes.

## Exercise

In groups of 4 determine on paper or on a whiteboard:

Consider:
- What entities/models would you have in your application?
- What relationships do these entities have with one another?

Then draw an ERD Diagram with relationships between the entities.
