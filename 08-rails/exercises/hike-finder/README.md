# Hike Finder: ActiveRecord Practice

## Introduction

Welcome to the Hike Finder exercises. This sequence of worksheets is designed to provide practice working with ActiveRecord models.

Each worksheet will begin by describing a database setup, then give a sequence of questions about how to interact with that database. Some questions will ask you for specific ruby code that could be typed at the Rails console or written in a controller, and some will be comprehension questions.

Each worksheet also has an answer sheet in the [solutions](solutions) directory. These are provided so that you can check your work. The recommended workflow is to complete an entire worksheet before looking at the answers, unless you get truly stuck.
