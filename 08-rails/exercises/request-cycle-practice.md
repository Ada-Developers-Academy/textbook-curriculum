# Request Cycle Practice

One of the major learning goals of Rails is to understand how the request cycle is executed through the Rails application, to and from the browser.

Here is the request cycle diagram as a reminder:

You'll use the RideShare Rails project as a reference for this exercise.
For this exercise you shall:
- redraw the Rails request cycle diagram
- choose one request that your partner worked on that you may not yet be familiar with
  - add the details for that request to the diagram
  - this should include things like the **HTTP verb, URL, controller action, model methods, view helpers, any redirects, file names etc**

Do this on a separate sheet of paper so you can turn this in to your instructor when it is due.
