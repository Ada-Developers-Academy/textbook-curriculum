# What is Ruby on Rails?
## Learning Goals
- Answer the question at the top of this document
- Internalize the Rails mantra of _Convention Over Configuration_
- Explore the `rails` CLI and the default directory structure of a Rails application.

## So what is it?
[Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) is a widely-used, Ruby-based __MVC__ web framework created in 2005 by [@dhh](https://twitter.com/dhh).

You've probably used web applications built in Rails:

- GitHub
- Twitter
- Disney
- Hulu
- Yellow Pages
- GroupOn
- LivingSocial
- IndieGoGo
- And a whole lot more

## Rails is a DSL
Rails is a __Domain-Specific Language__ for creating web pages.

Fully open source, it is constantly adapting to new trends and requirements of modern web development. It's distributed as a family of gems; there were ~28 individual gems last time I counted that made up the core of Rails. The philosophy of Rails (ostensibly) can be summarized by two statements:

1. DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself
1. Convention over Configuration

## Before We Begin

First let's install Rails version 5.

```bash
$ gem install rails --no-rdoc --no-ri
$ rails -v
```

You should see the rails version as `5.0.1` or later.

__Questions:__ Why `--no-rdoc` and `--no-ri`?

The docs take _a year_ to install, and we'll never look at them. There are docs that are easier to use than what's provided by rdoc & ri.

## Creating a New Rails Project
```bash
$ rails new rails-learning
```


## Whoa! What Happened?
The Rails gem includes a command-line program, `rails`, that has a number of options. With it we can start a server, quickly create new classes, work with the database, and many other things. The command `new` creates a new directory and creates all the subdirectories and files a Rails application needs to get started.

You can see all of the command line options that the Rails application builder accepts by running `$ rails new -h`.

## What's Inside?
Let's take a tour: `$ cd rails-learning/`

Here's a table I shamelessly stole from the [Rails Getting Started Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html):

|File/Folder|Purpose|
|:---:|-------------|
| app/        | Contains the controllers, models, views, helpers, mailers and assets for your application. You'll focus on this folder for the remainder of this guide. |
| bin/        | Contains the rails script that starts your app and can contain other scripts you use to setup, deploy or run your application. |
| config/     | Configure your application's routes, database, and more. This is covered in more detail in Configuring Rails Applications. |
| config.ru   | Rack configuration for Rack based servers used to start the application. |
| db/         | Contains your current database schema, as well as the database migrations. |
| Gemfile & Gemfile.lock | These files allow you to specify what gem dependencies are needed for your Rails application. These files are used by the Bundler gem. For more information about Bundler, see the [Bundler website](http://bundler.io/). |
| lib/        | Extended modules for your application. |
| log/        | Application log files. |
| public/     | The only folder seen by the world as-is. Contains static files and compiled assets. |
| Rakefile    | This file locates and loads tasks that can be run from the command line. The task definitions are defined throughout the components of Rails. Rather than changing Rakefile, you should add your own tasks by adding files to the lib/tasks directory of your application. |
| README.md | This is a brief instruction manual for your application. You should edit this file to tell others what your application does, how to set it up, and so on. |
| test/       | Unit tests, fixtures, and other test infrastructure. |
| tmp/        | Temporary files (like cache, pid, and session files). |
| vendor/     | A place for all third-party code. In a typical Rails application this includes vendored gems. |

## Starting A Rails Server

```bash
$ cd <my_project_folder>
$ rails server
```
![Rails Start Screen](images/rails5-start.jpeg)

This command starts the default web server `WEBrick` which we can access at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) on our computer. It will display the output of the log, showing all the errors, warnings, and notifications generated by the app, all the DB queries, and some basic timing information. Let's take a look at that!
