# HTML Forms
## Learning Goals
- Discover the mechanisms in the HTML standard that allow for interactive elements on a website
- Discuss how to create accessible and semantic forms
- Make and _post_ our first HTML form!

Forms are how users provide input to servers for operation. Everything from authoring a tweet to logging into an email account is accomplished using a small set of HTML tags that create and structure forms.

## Relevant Tags
- `<form>`
- `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` (handy, but not often used)
- `<label>`
- `<input>`
  - `<input type="text">`
  - `<input type="checkbox">`
  - `<input type="radio">`
  - `<input type="password">`
  - `<input type="submit">`
  - `<input type="hidden">`
- `<textarea>`
- `<select>`
  - `<option>`
- `<button>`, and `<input type="button">` (primarily used for JavaScript interactions)

## Creating and Submitting Forms
Forms are used to create requests to servers that can create, update, and delete resources.

We are going to look at how inputs from a form are passed along through the browser to our server. Let's open the web application we have been using and create a new route and view like:

```bash
$ touch app/views/books/new.html.erb
```

```ruby
# app/controllers/books_controller.rb
def new

end
```

Then, let's open the view (`app/views/books/new.html.erb`) in our editor. Add the following code to the page:

```html
<form action="/books" method="post" accept-charset="utf-8">
  <!-- SPECIAL INPUT TO ALLOW RAILS TO USE THIS FORM -->
  <input name="authenticity_token" value="<%= form_authenticity_token %>" type="hidden">


  <label for="title">Title</label>
  <input type="text" name="title" value="" id="title">

  <label for="author">Author</label>
  <input type="text" name="author" value="" id="author">

  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

In the `form` tag, the `action` attribute defines to which route this form will `POST`. We're using the route that corresponds to the RESTful POST route for creating a new entry. We know that submitting the form will create a `POST` request because that's the value of the `method` parameter. We could use `PUT`, `DELETE`, or any other verb (even `GET`, but that's kinda silly).

Next we have a `label` tag
```html
<label for="title">Title</label>
```

Labels are the text portion of a form. The reason we use labels instead of plain text is because we can join an `input` and a `label` to when the text is clicked the cursor will focus on the input. The `for` attribute defines the `id` that the `label` will match. Also, creating a link between the `label` and `input` tags is critical in creating usable form content for folks using screen readers.

Next we have two `input` tags with the type of 'text' (see [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) for all input info).

```html
<input type="text" name="title" value="" id="title">
<input type="text" name="author" value="" id="author">
```

Each `input` tag will pass a value along to the server when we submit the form. The data passed to the web server in our _POST request_ is collected in a Ruby hash called `params`. In this hash, the `name` attribute of the HTML `<input>` defines the key, and the user input is value. In this case `title` will be assigned to what we type into the first text field.

And finally we have an `input` with the type of _submit_. This input creates a button to click that will send an HTTP request with the form data to the route in the `action` attribute of the `form` tag.

Give it a try. It broke, right? We haven't taught our app how to make this work!

### Nested params
Let's make our form a little bit smarter. We can submit nested data by manipulating the `name` attribute.

```html
  <input type="text" name="book[title]" value="" id="title">
  <input type="text" name="book[author]" value="" id="author">
```

In Rails this is the way we _model_ data objects. We will expand upon this idea once we learn about Active Record, but until then, imagine a `Book` class where the initialize method is written to assign attributes from a hash. We would then pass the inner hash to the `new` method and all of our attributes would be assigned.

```ruby
# app/models/book.rb
class Book
  def initialize(options = {})
    @title = options[:title]
    @author = options[:author]
  end
end
```
```ruby
# app/controllers/books_controller.rb
book = Book.new(title: params[:book][:title], author: params[:book][:author])
```
